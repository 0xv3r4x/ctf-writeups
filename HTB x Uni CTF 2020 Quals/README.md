# HTB x University CTF 2020

This is the writeup for the 2020 HackTheBox University CTF.  This was completed in a 48 hour period in a team of 10.  It contained 32 challenges spanning several fields including web pentesting, cryptography, forensics, reverse engineering, etc.

This was my first CTF as part of a team and I found it pretty challenging.  I managed to complete two challenges (weak_rsa and kapKan) on my own but didn't manage to do anything past that without help from the team.
