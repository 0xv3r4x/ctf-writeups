# Tsunami | Warmups

*Woah! It's a natural disaster! But something doesn't seem so natural about this big wave...*

Opening the file in Sonic Visualiser.  File appears to be sounds of a wave, followed by an explosion, followed by strange beeps.

At first, I thought this was morse code, but adding a Spectrogram layer revealed the following text:

```
