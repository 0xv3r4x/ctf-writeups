# Bass64 | Warmups

*It, uh... looks like someone bass-boosted this? Can you make any sense of it?*

Opening the file in the browser and zooming out reveals ASCII art of `IGZsYWd7MzVhNWQxM2RhNmEyYWZhMGM2MmJmY2JkZDYzMDFhMGF9`.

Decoding this string from Base 64:

```
$ echo "IGZsYWd7MzVhNWQxM2RhNmEyYWZhMGM2MmJmY2JkZDYzMDFhMGF9" | base64 --decode
 flag{35a5d13da6a2afa0c62bfcbdd6301a0a}
